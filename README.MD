# 🌐 ZPI - Zig Package Index

Welcome to **ZPI (Zig Package Index)** — a simple, static website that serves as an open index of Zig packages and their documentation, inspired by sites like [crates.io](https://crates.io/) and [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/).

> ⚡ This project aims to make it easier for Zig developers to discover libraries, browse documentation, and quickly integrate packages — all without hosting any actual packages.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Browse Packages**: Discover available Zig packages across the community.
- 📄 **Read Docs**: View documentation and useful links for each package.
- 🔗 **Direct GitHub Integration**: All packages are hosted externally (e.g., GitHub) — ZPI simply indexes them.
- ⚙️ **Lightweight & Static**: Built with pure HTML/CSS/JS and hosted on GitHub Pages.

## 📦 How it Works

ZPI **does not host packages** itself. Instead, it acts as a catalog or "yellow pages" for Zig libraries:

1. Developers host their packages on GitHub (or elsewhere).
2. ZPI lists those packages with metadata, links, and installation instructions.
3. Users can find and copy the package URLs to use in their Zig projects.

---

## 🚀 Usage

Coming soon: CLI tooling and standardized metadata format for submitting packages.

For now, simply browse and copy the URLs manually!

## 🧪 Status

ZPI is in **early development**. We're experimenting with layout, metadata formats, and how best to serve the Zig community. Your feedback is incredibly valuable! 🙏
